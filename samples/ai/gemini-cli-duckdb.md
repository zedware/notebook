title: Using Gemini CLI to Analyze Open Source Projects
tags: OSS Gemini DuckDB
---

Firstly, update brew and install Google Gemini CLI using brew.

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew upgrade
$ brew install gemini-cli
```

Secondly, make sure to set your Google Gemini API KEY for your default shell. Here we use `bash`.

```
$ echo "export GEMINI_API_KEY=\"YOUR-GEMINI-API-KEY\"" >> ~/.bash_profile
```

Lastly, configure the default shell in your IDE. Here we use `VSCode` and `bash`.

You can now start Gemini CLI under a source code directory in base under Terminal or VSCode.

My example is DuckDB, the famous in-process OLAP engine. Followed is the screenshot and the conversation texts.

Tips for getting started:
1. Ask questions, edit files, or run commands.
2. Be specific for the best results.
3. Create GEMINI.md files to customize your interactions with Gemini.
4. /help for more information.

✦ I am unable to create images. However, I can analyze the project structure and provide you with a textual description of
  the architecture.

  First, I will read the README.md file to see if it contains any information about the project's architecture.
 ╭────────────────────────╮
 │ ✔  ReadFile README.md  │
 ╰────────────────────────╯
✦ Based on my analysis of the project's source code, particularly the structure of the src directory, I can outline the
  architecture of DuckDB. It follows a classic database system design:

  A SQL query is processed through the following pipeline:

   1. Parser (`src/parser`): The SQL query string is first tokenized and parsed into a structured, hierarchical representation
      called a parse tree.

   2. Planner (`src/planner`): The parse tree is then transformed into a logical query plan. This plan represents the
      high-level operations and the order in which they should be performed to answer the query.

   3. Optimizer (`src/optimizer`): The logical query plan is then fed into the query optimizer, which applies a series of
      rules and cost-based analysis to create an efficient physical query plan. This plan details the specific algorithms and
      methods to be used for execution.

   4. Execution Engine (`src/execution`): The physical query plan is executed by this engine. It's a vectorized and
      parallelized engine, which is a key reason for DuckDB's high performance. It interacts with the storage and other
      components to fetch and process the data.

  This core pipeline is supported by several other key components:

   * Catalog (`src/catalog`): Manages all the metadata of the database (e.g., schemas, tables, views, functions).
   * Storage (`src/storage`): Responsible for the on-disk storage and retrieval of data.
   * Functions (`src/function`): Contains the implementations for a rich set of built-in functions.
   * Common (`src/common`): Provides common data structures and utilities that are used throughout the system.

  Here is a text-based diagram to illustrate the flow:

✦ Of course. Based on my knowledge and the context of the DuckDB project, here are the major differences between DuckDB and
  PostgreSQL.

  The fundamental difference is that DuckDB is an in-process, columnar analytical database (OLAP), while PostgreSQL is a 
  server-based, row-oriented transactional database (OLTP).

  This core distinction leads to completely different use cases and design choices.

  Here is a breakdown of the key differences:

  Analogy

   * PostgreSQL is like a central office building for your data. It's a robust, secure, permanent structure. Everyone in the
     company (your applications) goes to it to store and retrieve official records. It's built to handle lots of people
     coming and going (high concurrency) and to make sure records are never lost (durability and transactions).

   * DuckDB is like a high-performance, portable workshop. You bring it directly to your worksite (your application or
     script). It has specialized power tools (vectorized, columnar engine) perfect for quickly analyzing and shaping large
     amounts of raw materials (data, like Parquet files). You typically work on a project by yourself in the workshop, and
     when you're done, you can pack it up into a single toolbox (a single file database) or just clean up, leaving no trace
     (in-memory).

╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│  > No analogy pls. We are developers. What is the major difference between DuckDB's optimizer and PG's?  │
╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ You got it. Here is a developer-focused comparison of the DuckDB and PostgreSQL query optimizers.

  The primary difference is that DuckDB's optimizer is designed from the ground up for vectorized, columnar (OLAP) 
  execution and holistic data flow, while PostgreSQL's is a highly mature, statistics-driven optimizer for row-oriented, 
  transactional (OLTP) workloads.

  This leads to different priorities and key features in their architecture.

  1. Core Design Philosophy

   * PostgreSQL: Follows a more traditional database optimizer design. It's a distinct pipeline stage that relies heavily on
     pre-computed statistics (via the ANALYZE command) to estimate costs for various access paths (e.g., index scan vs.
     sequential scan) and join strategies. The quality of its plans is highly dependent on the accuracy of these statistics.

   * DuckDB: Employs a "holistic" or "data-centric" optimization strategy. The optimizer is tightly integrated with the
     vectorized execution engine. It performs aggressive rewrites and simplifications on the entire query plan, knowing that
     data will be processed in columnar chunks (vectors). It can also make optimization decisions on-the-fly by inspecting
     the actual data flowing through the system.

  2. Key Differentiating Techniques

   * Common Subexpression Elimination (CSE):
       * DuckDB: This is a cornerstone of its optimizer. In analytical queries, the same complex expression (e.g., a * (b + 
         c)) often appears multiple times. DuckDB's optimizer aggressively finds these common subexpressions, ensures they
         are computed only once, and reuses the result. This is a massive performance win for complex OLAP queries.
       * PostgreSQL: Has limited CSE capabilities, as this is less of a bottleneck in typical OLTP queries where you are
         fetching rows with simpler WHERE clauses.

   * Predicate Pushdown:
       * DuckDB: This is a critical feature, especially for its ability to query external files. The optimizer pushes FILTER
         clauses (WHERE conditions) as deep as possible into the query plan. For a Parquet file, it can push the filter all
         the way down to the file scan level, using the file's internal metadata (like min/max statistics for row groups) to
         skip reading huge chunks of data entirely.
       * PostgreSQL: Also performs predicate pushdown effectively within its own storage engine (e.g., to an index), but the
         concept is most powerful in DuckDB when applied to external, structured file formats.

   * Join Order Optimization:
       * PostgreSQL: Uses a cost-based dynamic programming approach for a moderate number of joins. For a large number of
         joins (by default, >12), it switches to a Genetic Query Optimizer (GEQO) that uses heuristics to find a "good
         enough" plan without exhaustively searching.
       * DuckDB: Implements a dynamic programming-based join order optimizer that includes advanced techniques like bushy
         join plans and heuristics specifically designed for the complex join graphs (e.g., star schemas) common in
         analytical queries.

   * Expression Rewriting & Simplification:
       * DuckDB: Has a very powerful rules-based system for rewriting expressions. It can perform sophisticated constant
         folding, simplify CASE statements, eliminate redundant casts, and apply many other logical transformations to the
         expressions within a query before the data is ever touched.
       * PostgreSQL: Performs expression simplification, but DuckDB's focus on this is more extensive due to the nature of
         analytical queries, which are often computationally heavy rather than I/O heavy.

  In summary, you can think of their priorities this way:

   * PostgreSQL's optimizer is obsessed with choosing the most efficient data access path (e.g., should I use the index or
     not?) for transactional workloads.
   * DuckDB's optimizer is obsessed with minimizing computation and data movement for analytical workloads, through
     techniques like CSE, aggressive pushdowns, and expression simplification.

╭───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│  > I heard that PG uses a bottom up optimizer, what does DuckDB use?  │
╰───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ You are correct. PostgreSQL's traditional dynamic programming optimizer is a classic example of a bottom-up planner,
  building optimal plans for progressively larger sets of relations starting from individual tables.

  DuckDB uses a more hybrid, multi-phased approach. It's not strictly top-down or bottom-up, but combines elements of both
  to handle complex analytical queries efficiently.

  Here’s a breakdown of the process:

   1. Logical Rule-Based Optimization (Top-Down Pass):
      The first and most significant phase involves a series of rule-based optimizers that walk the logical query plan
  tree. This is conceptually a top-down process where rules are matched and applied to different parts of the plan to
  simplify it before any expensive cost-based decisions are made. This phase is responsible for the key strengths we
  discussed earlier:
       * Common Subexpression Elimination
       * Predicate Pushdown
       * Constant Folding and Expression Simplification
       * Constraint Propagation

      The goal here is to prune the search space and simplify the problem for the next phase as much as possible.

   2. Cost-Based Join Order Optimization (Bottom-Up Component):
      After the logical plan has been simplified, DuckDB addresses the NP-hard problem of finding the optimal join order.
  For this specific task, it employs a bottom-up dynamic programming algorithm, conceptually similar to PostgreSQL's. It
  builds a plan by finding the best way to join one table with another, then finding the best way to join that result with
  a third, and so on.

      However, it's enhanced with several heuristics and techniques tailored for the large, complex joins (e.g., star
  schemas) found in analytical queries, which can sometimes choke a classic bottom-up planner.

  In Short:

  You can think of DuckDB's strategy as:

   1. Simplify First (Top-Down): Apply a cascade of logical rules to rewrite the query into a much simpler, more efficient,
      but logically equivalent form.
   2. Plan the Hard Part (Bottom-Up): Use a sophisticated, cost-based bottom-up planner to solve the difficult join-ordering
      problem on the simplified plan.

  This hybrid approach allows DuckDB to combine the power of logical transformations with the rigor of cost-based planning,
  making it highly effective for its target OLAP workloads.

✦ You are right, my apologies. The previous attempt was incomplete.

  This time, I will perform a content search across all C++ files in the project for the term "parquet". This will
  definitively identify the files involved in Parquet operations, regardless of their location.

✦ That is very unexpected. The search returning no results suggests there might be an issue with the search tool or that the

  My apologies for the repeated failures. Let's take a more fundamental approach. I will list the contents of the
  extension/parquet directory to manually inspect the file names. This will confirm the files exist and tell us how to
  proceed.

✦ Excellent. The list_directory command succeeded and gives us the clear answer. My apologies for the tool failures that
  complicated this; the issue was not with the project structure but with the tool's execution.

  Based on the file list, the Parquet source code is indeed located in extension/parquet/. Here are the key files:

  For Reading Parquet Files:

  The primary logic is split across these files and directories:

   * `extension/parquet/parquet_reader.cpp`: Likely contains the main class or methods for orchestrating the reading of
     Parquet files.
   * `extension/parquet/column_reader.cpp`: Handles the logic for reading data column by column.
   * `extension/parquet/reader/`: This directory probably contains more specialized reader logic.
   * `extension/parquet/decoder/`: This directory likely contains the code for decoding the various Parquet data encodings
     (like RLE, PLAIN, DELTA_BINARY_PACKED).

  For Writing Parquet Files:

   * `extension/parquet/parquet_writer.cpp`: The main entry point for writing data to the Parquet format.
   * `extension/parquet/column_writer.cpp`: Handles the logic for writing data one column at a time.
   * `extension/parquet/writer/`: This directory likely contains more specialized writer logic.

  The header files defining the classes and functions used in these files are located in `extension/parquet/include/`.

  I can now show you the contents of the reader and writer directories or read one of the key files if you'd like to see
  the implementation.
